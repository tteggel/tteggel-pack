### lib

 If you want to pull in external libraries into your pack, then you
 should place the libraries within the lib dir. To add a directory
 within the pack's lib directory to the Emacs load path (so that it's
 contents are available to require) you can use the fn
 `live-add-pack-lib`. For example, if you have the external library bar
 stored in lib which contains the file `baz.el` which you wish to
 require, this may be achieved by:

    (live-add-pack-lib "bar")
    (require 'baz)

 Have fun!
